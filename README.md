## Data Sourcing

The dataset was provided by [Rishabh Mishra](https://www.youtube.com/@RishabhMishraOfficial) . I am greatful for his guidance throughout this project.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage began with getting to know the dataset and checking for any data quality issues.
1.	Checking NULL values, blanks and Errors 
2.	Removing duplicates, and irrelevant columns.
3.	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
4.	Creating 2 new attributes 'Age Group' and 'Month' were added for logical and easy interpretation of dataset.

## Data Analysis

Six pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between sales and other factors such as gender, orders in diff months, top states. Trends in order status, orders on diff channels orders and age comparison were also performed.

## Data Visualization

Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table. For user friendly and interactive experience 3 "Slicers" were added.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
